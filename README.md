# Arduino-Drums-Set
CS 207 Project 2017. drums kit made on Arduino Uno.

How it works:

In simple terms, the player hits the drum pads that have piezo transducers on them, sensor registers a hit, sends data to arduino board which sends the MIDI data to computer. There are multiple ways of processing that data on computer, for more details check Design Process. Our group has decided to use MacOS to host the drum set, so we use a special software called Ardumo (can be downloaded from here: ), that processes the data from arduino and creates a MIDI input for the Garage Band.
